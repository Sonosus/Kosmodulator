This is a PCB fo Kosmo modular synthesizers that enables the user to have a larger control surface for that tiny attenuator pot or that tiny frequency control that's shoved in that tiny corner in between the patch cables... You get the idea.

It is capable of generating voltages between +12V and -12V, adjusted by a pot. The upper and lower voltage limits are set using 2 rotary switches. 
The module also has a delta output, which is an AC coupled output that sends only the _changes_ in the pot's voltage. Both sets of outputs have inverted options. The resistance of the RC combination can be changed via a third rotary switch.
More docs, BOM, build notes to come soon.
